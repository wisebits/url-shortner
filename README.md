## URL Shortner

An URL shortner is a service that basically renders a shorter url for the one being provided (usually long). In this project, we will implement this service in a secure way that allows users to auto-generate a short URL that is secure and shareable among users with proper permission. Additionally, authors and users with the proper permission will be able to access a dashboard and obtain insights into the traffic information pertaining to the URL provided.

## Installation Instructions
