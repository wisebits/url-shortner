## URL Shortner Project - Short Description

An url shortener is a service that basically renders a shorter url for the one being provided (usually long). 
In this project we will implement this service in a secure way that allows users to auto generate a short url
that is secure and shareable among users with proper permission. Additionally, authors and users with the proper
permission will be able to access a dashboard and obtain insights into the traffic information pertaining to the url provided.
