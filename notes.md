## Elvis Notes
1. Permissions can use uuid and might also need to encrypted. We don't want other users to see this information (Let us think of it as a configuration file used in the example by the professor). 
2. Permission might also be missing some information
3. Everything in the View (Analytics Info) should be restricted. This sort of information may only be accessible by author or those people with privileges.
4. Full_Urls shouldn't be viewable by other people except those with permissions handed to them by the author.
